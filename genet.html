    <h1>Genet</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A genet is a member of the genus Genetta, which consists of 17 species of small African carnivorans. The common genet is the only genet present in Europe and occurs in the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and France.
    </p>
    <p>
        Genet fossils from the Late Miocene and later have been found at sites in Ethiopia, Kenya and Morocco.

    <h2>Classification</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Genetta was named and described by Frédéric Cuvier in 1816.[6] The number of species in the genus is controversial. The following were proposed as valid in 2005:  
        <ul>
            <li>Common genet</li>
            <li>Cape genet</li>
            <li>South African small-spotted genet</li>
            <li>Rusty-spotted genet</li>
            <li>Pardine genet</li>
            <li>Abyssinian genet</li>
            <li>King genet</li>
            <li>Servaline genet</li>
            <li>Angolan genet</li>
            <li>Giant forest genet</li>
            <li>Hausa genet</li>
            <li>Letaba genet</li>
            <li>Johnston's genet</li>
            <li>Aquatic genet</li>
            <li>Crested servaline genet</li>
            <li>Schouteden's genet</li>
            <li>Bourlon's genet</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Extinct species</h3>
    <p>
        Genetta and Poiana are estimated to have diverged about 9.5 to 13.3 million years ago. Genetta species are estimated to have diverged at least 8.5 million years ago starting with the Hausa genet, followed by the giant genet 3.98 to 6.01 million years ago.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Genets are slender cat-like animals with a long body, a long ringed tail, large ears, a pointed muzzle and partly retractile claws. Their fur is spotted, but melanistic genets have also been recorded. They have musk glands and anal sacs. They also have perineal glands.
    </p>
    <p>
        All genet species have a dark stripe along the spine; they differ in fur color and spot pattern. Their size varies between species from 40.9 to 60 cm (16.1 to 23.6 in) in head-to-body length with 40 to 47 cm (16 to 19 in) long tails; their tails are almost as long as head and body. They have large eyes with elliptical pupils; the iris is about the color of the fur. They can move their eyes within their sockets to a limited extent, and move their heads to focus on moving objects. Their pinnae have a fine layer of hair inside and outside. They can move the pinnae by about 80° from pointing forward to the side, and also from an erect position to pointing downwards. Their rhinarium is important for both sensing smell and touch.
